          <p>The Giants have had many talented defenders over the decades, including Harry Carson, Carl Banks, Michael Strahan, and Justin Tuck, but none epitomize the G-Men defense better than Hall Of Fame Linebacker Lawrence Taylor.  Widely considered the best overall defensive player in NFL history, LT made the Pro Bowl in each of his first 10 seasons and even managed to put together 7 straight double-digit sack seasons.  The league's MVP in 1986, Taylor headlines the Mount Rushmore of pass-rushers, and could take over any game from any spot on the field.</p>

          <p>The Giants have had no shortage of offensive ability throughout their history, with tremendous talents like Phil Simms, Amani Toomer, Tiki Barber, Victor Cruz, and Saquon Barkley in each era.  Regardless, the franchise's former captain and 2x Super Bowl champition definitively sits atop the offensive legacy boards.  Top ten all-time in yardage, touchdowns, and consecutive games played, Eli Manning was a champion on and off the field, and his ability to perform in the biggest of moments, under the brighest of lights, undoubtedly places him among the best that Big Blue has to offer. </p>
